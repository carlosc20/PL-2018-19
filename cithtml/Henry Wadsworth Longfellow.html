<body><h1>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h1>
</br>“If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.”</br></br>“One half of the world must sweat and groan that the other half may dream.”</br></br>“Sometimes we may learn more from a man's errors, than from his virtues.”</br></br>“There's nothing in this world so sweet as love, and next to love the sweetest thing is hate.”</br></br>“We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.”</br></br>“The strength of criticism lies in the weakness of the thing criticized.”</br></br>“The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain.”</br></br>“People demand freedom only when they have no power.”</br></br>“Most people would succeed in small things if they were not troubled with great ambitions.”</br></br>“It takes less time to do a thing right, than it does to explain why you did it wrong.”</br></br>“If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it; every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth.”</br></br>“O hoje e o ontem são as pedras com que construímos.”</br></br>“Faz-me bem ser um pouco ressequido pelo calor e encharcado pela chuva de vida”</br></br>“Em cada vida alguma chuva deve cair, e alguns dias devem ser escuros e sombrios”</br>
