<body><h1>Blair Waldorf</h1>
</br>“If you wanna be part of this world, Jenny, people will talk, eventually. You need to decide if all this is worth it.”</br></br>“Haven't you heard? I'm the crazy bitch around here”</br></br>“Serena likes to see the best of people, I like to see the truth”</br></br>“It’s no use to deny the past. Chuck is a part of me. He’ll always be.”</br></br>“I said civilized, not lobotomized.”</br></br>“Why don't you just sky write the word ”</br></br>“Blair: I could never like you either. In fact, I hate you.”</br>
