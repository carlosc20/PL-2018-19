</br>“Sharing stories came to me pretty late in life, but the day I got the hang of it, I began to understand the incredible power of letting your guard down. even with people you barely know. Because when you open yourself, people will magically open up to you”</br></br>“We want love. We want to feel beautiful. We want to be good friends, good partners, good sisters, good daughters. We want to know how to never buy the wrong pair of shoes again. (Sorry to inform you, but you will keep making shoes mistakes until the day tou die. So celebrate being alive right now!) We want to feel fulfilled by the work that we do, whatever that work may be. Most of all, we want to find our place in this world”</br></br>“I learn that I'm not immune to trends and that being a fashion victim is essentially being a victim. Yep. That's all I lean, but the lesson is totally worth it. ”</br></br>“Any body type can look beautiful, under the right conditions, but let's be honest: It's just easier to wear whats you see on the runway if you're skinny and relatively flat-chested with narrow hips. It's boring, annoying, wrong, and sucks”</br></br>“Our clothes carry the message we want to convey to others, and it changes, depending on what we're going through in our lives”</br></br>“Borrow from your dreams. Of being a movie star. A great lover. A great mother. A respected teacher. A free spirit. An astrologer. An artist. A painter, a sculptor. Whatever they are, these dreams are ours and they make us. They guide us in our style - and in our lives”</br></br>“The Frech woman is nonchalant and will apply herself to carryng that stance in every aspect of her life. In France, we're not supposed to stande out too much. Wanting to show off is suspect. It doesn't mean matters of style and beauty are overlooked, but they are very carefully cultivated to look effortless and not overshadow your neighbor”</br></br>“Trends are fun to read about in a magazine on a Sunday morning, and shopping is a perfect time to catch up with friends, but tha's about where it ends. The French woman will only buy a trendy item if she is sure she can make ir work in her wardrobe, but being too on trend is suspect, means you're a fashion victim, and -horror!- that you want to stand out”</br></br>“The tuxedo is a secret agent. It makes you beautiful without beig about it. It's opposite of a sublime evening gown that everyone remembers even better than they remember you. You know, the kind you can only wear once, no matter how much you love it, because everyone will notice”</br></br>“Losing yourself only takes a second, but finding your way back can take years”</br>
